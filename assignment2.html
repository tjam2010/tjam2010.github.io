        <h2> Schematic </h2>
        <img src="a2_schematic.JPG" width=400></a>
        Image 2. A schematic of the LED x Button circuit. 
        The green and blue LEDs are using 330 ohm resistors. Given a 3.2 voltage drop, and V=IR, 5-3.2=x*330, we have a current of 12mA.
        The button uses a 10k ohm resistor. This is to function as a pulldown and to avoid leaving our 5V input hanging without an out. The 10k ohm resistor was chosen because it is enough to establish a LOW state when the button is not pressed.

        <h2> Code </h2>
        <pre> 
//initializes a variable for determining if the button is pressed
int buttonState = 0;

void setup() {
  //establishes built in led as an output
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  //establishes green led as an output
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  //establishes blue led as an output
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  //establishes pin 2 as an input for the button status
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
}

void loop () {
  //checks to see if button is pressed
  buttonState = digitalRead(2);
  //if the button is pressed
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    //turn on the built in LED
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
    // fade the brightness using a loop from 255 to 0
    for (int i = 255; i > -1; i--) {
      //set the green led brightness to the current number of the loop
      analogWrite(10, i);
      // wait .005 seconds
      delay(5);
    }
  }
  // if the button is not pressed
  else {
    //turn off the built in LED
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);
    // fade the brightness using a loop from 255 to 0
    for (int i = 255; i > -1; i--) {
      //set the blue led brightness to the current number of the loop
      analogWrite(9, i);
      // wait .005 seconds
      delay(5);
    }
  }
}

        <h2> Circuit Operation </h2>

        Image 4. The circuit operating such that the blue led flashes on and fades off. If the button is pressed, the green led performs the operation instead.
