        <h2> Schematic </h2>
        <img src="a4_schematic.JPG" width=400></a>
        <br/> 
        Image 2. A schematic of the Transistor x IR sensor circuit. 
        <br/>        
        The blue LEDs is using a 330 ohm resistor. Given a 3.2 voltage drop, and V=IR, 5-3.2=x*330, we have a current of 12mA,which is safe for the LED.
        The photoresistor works alongside a 10k ohm resistor. This allows there to be a small amount of current without preventing data from being read by our A0 pin.
        The voltage recorded by the analog read at the voltage divide (the wire going to pin A0), is dependent upon the photoresistor's light input.
        <pre>        
        That voltage can be calculated by finding the current across both resistors...
        V = I*(R1+R2)
        5 = I*(R1+10,000)
        5/(R1+10,000) = I
        and then calculating the voltage remaining after R1 and before R2...
        Vout = Itotal*R2
        Vout = (5*10,000)/(R1+10,000)
        Vout = 50,000/(R1+10,000)
        where R1 is dependent upon the amount of light it is receiving. 
        </pre>
        This value of voltage is important for our code, as we will map it to the brightness of our LED.

        Image 3. The final circuit, with an LED strip attached to a 12v power supply, an N-Fet transistor, and an IR receiver.
        <h2> Code </h2>
        <pre>//initializes pin modes
void setup() {
  //sets digital pin 12 as our led output
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  //sets analog 0 to be our sensor input
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);
  //sets the baud rate for the serial monitor and enables said monitor
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

//listens for changes in voltage and affects the led accordingly
void loop() {
  //provides a constant read-out of the unfiltered sensor value
  Serial.println(analogRead(A0));
  //lowest read A0 value = 370, (370 x .049 = 1.813 Volts)
  //highest read A0 value = 730, (730 x .049 = 3.577 Volts)
  //constrains the sensor values to more accurately reflect possible voltage reads
  int sensorVal = constrain(analogRead(A0),380,720);
  //maps sensed darkness with brighter led output and brightness with dim led output
  int outputVal = map(sensorVal, 720, 380, 0, 255);
  //outputs to the led depending upon the brightness sensed
  analogWrite(11, outputVal);
}
</pre>
