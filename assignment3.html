        <h2> Schematic </h2>
        <img src="a3_schematic.JPG" width=400></a>
        Image 2. A schematic of the LED x Button circuit. 
        The green and blue LEDs are using 330 ohm resistors. Given a 3.2 voltage drop, and V=IR, 5-3.2=x*330, we have a current of 12mA.
        The button uses a 10k ohm resistor. This is to function as a pulldown and to avoid leaving our 5V input hanging without an out. The 10k ohm resistor was chosen because it is enough to establish a LOW state when the button is not pressed. 
        <h2> Circuit </h2>

        Image 3. The final circuit, with three individually functional LEDs.
        <h2> Code </h2>
        <pre> 
//the funciton to initialize pin modes
void setup() {
  //sets digital pin 12 as our led output
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  //sets analog 0 to be our sensor input
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);
}

//listens for changes in voltage and affects the led accordingly
void loop() {
  //listens to see if the voltage is less that 3.92 volts
  if (analogRead(A0) < 800) {
    //turns on the led
    digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  }
  else {
    //turns off the led
    digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  }
}
</pre>
        <h2> Circuit Operation </h2>

        Image 4. The circuit operating such that the blue led flashes on and fades off. If the button is pressed, the green led performs the operation instead.
